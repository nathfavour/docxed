note:

1. never directly modify file system even if told at first time, during tackling a problem. first detail how you would approach the task, with snippets if possible, and ask for approval before proceeding to implement those changes

2. never run commands in terminal, except explicitly told to suggest commands to run. you could just simply add the text snippet of the command suggestion to be run however.
