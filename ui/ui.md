# Abstracktion UI Framework Guidelines

## Overview
Abstracktion is a UI framework guideline inspired by real-world environments, aiming to create digital interfaces that closely mirror physical spaces. All implementations must use code (not static assets) to achieve realism, leveraging dynamic rendering, shadows, reflections, and perspective.

## Core Principles

- **Real-World Parallels:** Every UI element should evoke a real-world counterpart (e.g., doors for transitions, windows for modals).
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Use code to simulate sun angles, time-of-day, and environmental lighting. Shadows and reflections must adjust accordingly.
- **Perspective & Depth:** Employ 3D looks and perspective projections to create spatial depth.
- **No Asset Reliance:** All visuals must be generated programmatically; no image assets or textures.
- **Theme Consistency:** Each screen or component should reflect a chosen subtheme, with transitions and interactions grounded in physical metaphors.

## General Guidelines

1. **Transitions & Navigation**
    - Initial, login, and logout pages should resemble entryways (doors, gates, openings).
    - Transitions between screens should mimic physical movement (sliding, opening, fading as if moving through space).

2. **Shadows & Reflections**
    - All elements cast realistic, dynamic shadows based on a virtual light source.
    - Surfaces may reflect other UI elements, especially in metallic or polished themes.

3. **Perspective**
    - Use perspective transforms to give depth to containers, cards, and dialogs.
    - Elements closer to the user appear larger and more detailed.

4. **Time of Day**
    - UI adapts to day/night cycles, gradually shifting colors, shadows, and brightness.
    - All elements respond to the current "environmental" state.

## Subthemes

### 1. Woodbrick (Elegant)
- **Inspiration:** Warm, wood-like surfaces with brick accents.
- **Colors:** Predefined palette of browns, reds, and creams.
- **Details:** Subtle wood grain patterns, soft shadows, and gentle highlights.

### 2. Industrial
- **Inspiration:** Metallic, polished, and robust.
- **Colors:** Grays, silvers, blues.
- **Details:** Strong reflections, sharp shadows, and visible "rivets" or seams.

### 3. Nature
- **Inspiration:** Outdoors, greenery, sunlight.
- **Colors:** Greens, earth tones, sky blues.
- **Details:** Dappled shadows, gradients mimicking sunlight, organic shapes.

### 4. Slums
- **Inspiration:** Improvised, rugged, textured.
- **Colors:** Muted earth tones, rust, faded paint.
- **Details:** Uneven surfaces, layered elements, patchwork effects.

### 5. Night & Day
- **Implementation:** All themes must support dynamic transitions between night and day, with gradual color and shadow adjustments.

### 6. Indoors/Outdoors
- **Indoors:** Softer lighting, enclosed spaces, muted echoes.
- **Outdoors:** Brighter, open, with environmental effects (e.g., sunbeams, breezes).

## Implementation Notes

- **Responsiveness:** All guidelines apply across all screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast and clarity in all themes.
- **Customization:** Developers can extend subthemes but must adhere to the real-world mirroring principle.

## Example: Transition Page (Logout)
- **Visual:** A door slowly closes, casting a long shadow, with the background fading to a hallway or exterior.
- **Code:** All effects (door, shadow, fade) are rendered using CSS, SVG, or canvasâ€”no images.

By following these guidelines, applications built with Abstracktion will offer immersive, real-world-inspired experiences, fully generated by code.
