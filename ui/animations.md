# Abstracktion UI Framework Animation Guidelines

## Overview
Animations in Abstracktion must reinforce the framework’s core principle: digital interfaces that evoke real-world physicality. All animations are to be generated programmatically (CSS, SVG, Canvas, or WebGL), never with pre-rendered assets.

---

## Core Animation Principles

- **Physical Metaphors:** Animations should mimic real-world physics—momentum, inertia, elasticity, and friction.
- **Environmental Awareness:** Animation timing, direction, and intensity must respond to virtual lighting, time-of-day, and environmental context.
- **Subtheme Consistency:** Each subtheme’s animations should reflect its material qualities (e.g., wood creaks, metal clangs, leaves flutter).
- **No Asset Reliance:** All motion, effects, and transitions are code-driven.

## General Animation Guidelines

1. **Transitions & Navigation**
    - **Entry/Exit:** Use door-like swings, slides, or folds for page transitions.
    - **Modals/Dialogs:** Animate as windows opening/closing, with perspective and shadow changes.
    - **Navigation:** Movement should feel like traversing space—sliding, panning, or zooming with depth cues.

2. **Microinteractions**
    - **Buttons:** Pressing a button depresses it with a subtle shadow shift and spring-back.
    - **Toggles/Switches:** Animate as levers or switches flipping, with inertia and bounce.
    - **Hover/Focus:** Elements gently lift, cast deeper shadows, or subtly reflect surroundings.

3. **Shadows & Reflections**
    - **Dynamic Shadows:** Shadows stretch, shrink, and soften based on element movement and virtual light source.
    - **Reflections:** Surfaces animate reflected elements in sync with their movement.

4. **Perspective & Depth**
    - **3D Transforms:** Animate containers/cards/dialogs with perspective shifts as they move closer or farther.
    - **Parallax:** Background and foreground elements move at different speeds to enhance depth.

5. **Time of Day & Environment**
    - **Day/Night Transitions:** Animate gradual color, brightness, and shadow changes across the UI.
    - **Environmental Effects:** Animate sunbeams, breezes, or dappled light overlays in response to theme.

## Subtheme Animation Notes

- **Woodbrick:** Animations are smooth, with gentle easing and soft shadow transitions. Subtle “creak” or “grain” effects on movement.
- **Industrial:** Snappier, more rigid animations. Metallic reflections shimmer and shadows are sharp.
- **Nature:** Organic, flowing motions. Elements sway, ripple, or flutter; shadows dapple and shift.
- **Slums:** Uneven, layered animations. Elements may “jitter” or “slide” imperfectly, with patchwork reveals.
- **Night & Day:** All animations adapt to lighting changes—slower, softer at night; brighter, crisper by day.
- **Indoors/Outdoors:** Indoors, animations are muted and contained; outdoors, they are broader, with environmental overlays.

## Implementation Notes

- **Performance:** All animations must be performant and hardware-accelerated where possible.
- **Accessibility:** Provide reduced-motion options and ensure animations do not hinder usability.
- **Customization:** Developers may extend animations but must maintain physical metaphors and code-driven rendering.

## Example: Modal Opening Animation

- **Visual:** A modal “window” swings open from a wall, casting a moving shadow that lengthens and softens as it settles.
- **Code:** Use CSS 3D transforms and dynamic box-shadow, calculated based on virtual light source.

By following these animation guidelines, Abstracktion UIs will feel immersive, tactile, and alive—always grounded in real-world metaphors and fully generated by code.
