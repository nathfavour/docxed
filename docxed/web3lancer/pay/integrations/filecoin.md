‚ö°Ô∏è Hack The Decentralized Economy with USDFC on Filecoin
üß©
Challenge Overview
Build with USDFC ‚Äî a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by FIL ‚Äî and create powerful applications in finance, data, and infrastructure. Use USDFC‚Äôs stability to solve real-world problems, with full flexibility in how you build. The USDFC Secured Finance Stablecoin SDK and Secured Finance SF SDK give you direct access to core functionality like vaults, minting, redemptions, and more. Whether you‚Äôre building tools, automations, or DeFi integrations ‚Äî this is your playground.

Example project ideas
Problem: Legal contracts on centralized platforms can be deleted or tampered, leaving parties screwed. Idea: A contract platform storing USDFC-backed agreements on FVM, with a UI for signing and access logs to prove authenticity.
Problem: DeFi investors get burned when protocol changes (like fee hikes) aren‚Äôt transparently logged. Idea: A DeFi audit trail storing governance votes and code updates in USDFC-paid storage, with a public dashboard for transparency.
Problem: Supply chain payments get disputed when shipment records vanish.Idea: A trade tracking app using USDFC for payments, with immutable shipment logs accessible via a secure portal.
Problem: High friction in converting FIL to stable USD for on-chain payments.Idea: A USDFC on/off-ramp platform with a simple UI for seamless conversions and payments.
Problem: USDFC contract bugs slip through, risking funds and trust.Idea: A testing kit with mock USDFC transactions on FVM testnet to catch errors before launch.
Problem: Open-source coders get no cut when their code trains AI models for free. Idea: A code repo market paying USDFC for AI-used snippets, with a wallet for devs to cash out.
Problem: Predatory platform fees that eat 20-30% of earnings. Idea: A marketplace paying USDFC with minimal fees.
