Compose the Future on Stellar
The best smart contract platforms aren't just builtâ€”they're built together. Composability is key to a thriving ecosystem, and that starts with you. Instead of building from scratch, join us for the first of our mini-hackathon series where we spotlight and build directly on top of real, live projects on Stellar.

This month's featured project is Blend, one of the hottest projects on Stellar. Blend is set of DeFi primitives that empowers any entity to permissionlessly create its own secure and capital-efficient lending market. Its security is rooted in isolated lending pools and a mandatory insurance backstop module, while its reactive interest rate mechanism ensures capital is always working efficiently. By providing these core building blocks, Blend unlocks new possibilities for leveraged trading, yield products, and innovative DeFi apps on Stellar.

The Challenge: Build on Blend
This isn't about broad concepts; it's about targeted innovation. Your mission is to build a new tool, feature, or integration that directly leverages or enhances the Blend borrowing and lending platform. We want to see how you can use Blend as a foundational layer to create new user experiences and financial solutions.



Workshop Presentation

Inspiration & Ideas
Need a spark? Here are some ideas the ecosystem would love to see built on top of Blend:

New Frontends & Interfaces:
Alternative frontends for Comet or YieldBlox.
A simplified "position maker" interface inspired by Robinhood.
A user-friendly tool for creating new Blend pools.
Tooling & Integrations:
Seamless wallet integrations.
A transaction bundler to streamline complex operations.
Bridge integrations to bring new assets and users to Blend.
Risk & Alert Systems:
A visualizer for pool risk spread.
A liquidation alert system to notify users of at-risk positions.
"Buy Now, Pay Later" style features for risk-based transactions or NFT marketplaces like LiteMint.
Notification system to let you know if you're better off moving your assets to a different pool for higher yield.
Innovative DeFi & GameFi:
Launchpad functionalities built on top of Blend's liquidity.
Creative lottery, prediction market, or other GameFi applications.
Integrations with the Stellar Community Fund (SCF), such as creating a dedicated Blend pool for SCF projects.
