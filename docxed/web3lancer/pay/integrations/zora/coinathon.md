Main Challenge & Bounties
Main Challenge
Prize Pool
Total Prize Pool: 55,555 OP

The Challenge
Traditional social platforms abstract and extract all the value created by the people who make it all happen. Creators struggle to monetize and earn directly from their supporters.

Consumers give their attention and get nothing back. The platforms win. Advertisers win. Users mostly lose.

We challenge you to build new tools and experiences that enable direct exchange, explicit value, real rewards between creators and supporters.
