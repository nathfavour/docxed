A 2-weeks Hackathon to Learn, Buidl, and Earn on Umi
​Umi Network brings you try-a-thon, a series of 2 hackathons for students, builders and hackers where you can learn, build, and ship a project on Umi with a prize pool of $2000!

​At Umi Try-a-thon, you can expect a 2-weeks long experience of coding, learning, networking, and having fun.

​While you work towards building any project you want to, you will be complemented with informative workshops, enjoyable mini-games and cool prizes.

​The hackathon is open to all kinds of projects across themes, but here are a few things we’re actively thinking about these days in case you’re looking for some inspiration:

​Promote Decentralization. Create developer tooling and community projects focussed on promoting and bringing more decentralization to Umi as well as the world at large.

What to build?
You can build any decentralized applications you'd like, but here are some ideas to give you inspiration.

Engaging Apps: Build something people can engage a lot, like a prediction market, an NFT collection or a simple fun game.

​Streaming Payments: Make apps using Streamflow or similar protocols to make payroll, commerce, content, and subscription management platforms that make users feel the full magic of streaming payments.

​DAO Tooling: Create coordination, communication, and payment tools for communities using Umi as the backbone of their infrastructure.

​Developer Tooling: Create tools, programs, and hacks, making it easier and faster for engineers to build the next generation of dApps on Umi.

​Cause-driven building: We’re also looking to fund projects and research around using crypto to create a more inclusive financial system and innovative solutions towards climate change.
