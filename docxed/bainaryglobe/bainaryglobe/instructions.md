we want to structure the main website of a very large, global saas startup (like google) but bigger, better. we need to plan the website architecture and focus mostly on modularity (i.e  having an admin section where admin and privileged users can modify website live, create blogs, update site data, without touching code, right within the site itself. everything has to be ultra modular, ultra expanable, scalable). also, we will be using the color brown and yellow as major colors and green as minor color, and subtle, muted shades of them. so we have all the major features of a saas, home page, about, footer, etc sections and all these built atop of a very flexible, secure, modular permission based crud sustem that can change literally anything and everything in the frotnend, right from the frontend itself. we will be connecting to appwrite backend.

keep dependencies to an absolute minimul.

we will just use nextjs, appwrite, tailwind. only add absolutely necessary dependencies.

as for the database, note that this saas itself is not the product; it is a comglomerate of products just like google has deepmind, gmail, etc

each of these products are modular and can eiether be standalone or connect robustly to a robust system built into this project. also with a robust permission system for a robust company.

very importantly, it provides a 'sign in with' oauth feature so that all of it's products can optioally sign in with it's own inbuilt independent oauth system. for example, this is bainaryglobe so bainaryglobe's product can use 'sign in with bainaryglobe'. Also, third party applications should also be able to do this. infact, it would be good if it's developed robustly, but with the option for an internal flag of 'ourApp' to decide whether the third party project trying to use it's oauth belongs to the company, and this will allow to skip certain verification procedures and just plug in with minimal hoops. this feature, is the flagship of this project as integration, modularity is a forefront.

@/ import schemes are preferred.

src/types/appwrite.d.ts is autogenerated and should not be edited. it should be utilized extensively in the application.
