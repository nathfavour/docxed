# BainaryGlobe SaaS Website Build Plan

## 1. Project Setup
- Initialize Next.js project.
- Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Set up Appwrite backend (self-hosted or cloud).
- Configure environment variables for Appwrite.

## 2. Core Architecture
- Design modular folder structure for pages, components, and admin features.
- Implement global layout and theming (brown/yellow/green, muted shades).
- Set up Tailwind config for custom colors.

## 3. Authentication & Permissions
- Integrate Appwrite authentication (email/password, OAuth).
- Implement permission-based access control for CRUD operations.
- Create user roles: Admin, Privileged, Regular.

## 4. Admin Section
- Build admin dashboard accessible only to privileged users.
- Enable live editing of site content (blogs, pages, footer, etc.) via CRUD UI.
- Use Appwrite database for storing and updating content.

## 5. Dynamic Content Management
- Create modular components for Home, About, Footer, Blog, etc.
- Fetch and render content dynamically from Appwrite.
- Allow admins to create/update/delete content from frontend.

## 6. CRUD System
- Build generic CRUD UI components (forms, tables, editors).
- Connect CRUD operations to Appwrite database and permissions.
- Ensure all frontend changes are reflected live.

## 7. Security & Scalability
- Enforce secure access to admin features.
- Validate all user inputs.
- Optimize for scalability (code splitting, caching, SSR/ISR).

## 8. Minimal Dependencies
- Use only Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Appwrite.
- Avoid unnecessary libraries.

## 9. Testing & Deployment
- Write unit and integration tests for critical features.
- Deploy to Vercel or similar platform.
- Monitor and maintain uptime and performance.

## 10. Future Expansion
- Plan for easy addition of new modules/features.
- Document architecture for contributors.
