# mockup clip description.

so this features a telegram profile screen

he has a bunch of gifts around his profile icon, and these gifts animate around his head


(gifts are like stickers or emojis, some animated e.g with sparkles around them, some actually move themselves, etc)

when the profile is scrolled down and the profile icon itself is being scrolled out of view, these gifts converge into the profile icon as it scrolls upwards.

at the same the same time as it scrolls upwards (the profile icon) it get's smaller, and moves upwards until converting into a point (basically vanishes) at the top, middle of the screen. this is basically vertical and miniization motion of the profile itself as gifts also converge into it and disappear, while doing so.

i suspect this is not much different from the curren profile itself; just a minor tweak to the profile to add gifts animations and transitions, or profile icon vanishing, if not already existent (you analyze and see what is actually already present so we don't reimplement as they don't talk much about the task so we have to figure these things out) (I think)
