Telegram is hosting a contest for Android developers to implement a redesigned profile appearance.

THE TASK

Rework the existing profile screens by implementing the new design flow in strict accordance with the mockups provided below:
– Profiles of users, businesses, groups, and channels must be covered, including groups with topics enabled.
– Support for both day and night themes is mandatory.

💡 For this task, we recommend building the relevant screens from scratch. However, reusing existing code components is acceptable.

Contest Requirements:

– No third-party UI frameworks are allowed.
– The submission must be consistent with the existing Telegram for Android codebase. (https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) 
– The app's stability and performance must not be affected with the changes you made.
– The app must be free of significant flaws (including crashes, visual glitches, noticeable element blinking, layout errors, and more).

❗️The implementation must precisely follow the provided design mockups, including all transitions shown in the animated demos.

Evaluation:
During the evaluation stage, we will review your code and test the submission on a wide range of Android devices.
