We are pleased to issue the following clarifications regarding the Android Contest (https://t.me/contest/420).

Q: Do I need to build these screens as a standalone project?
A: You must implement the new screens directly into the Telegram for Android app (https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram), fully preserving all existing profile features. To sum up – the new design flow must replace the current one.

Q: How will I submit my work and what will I need to provide?
A: You’ll need to submit both: an .APK file, and a link to your GitHub repository. For reference, here are the submission guidelines (https://t.me/contest/389) from one of our previous Android contests.

Q: Can we get the source files for the design mockups and animated demo?
A: Please use the files that have already been provided.

Q: Can I use X, Y, Z? 
A: You must use Java without any third-party UI frameworks – and you should avoid introducing new dependencies into the project. To sum up – any changes you make must remain consistent with the existing codebase.

Q: What are the floating icons that get hidden when a profile is collapsed?
A: These icons come from either the custom profile appearance or from an active gift. For reference, check out @durov.

Q: Can we further utilize the camera cutout position on certain devices?
A: Absolutely.

Q: Do I really need to build the profiles from scratch?
A: We do not impose any restrictions on whether you should build it from scratch or not – focus on the outcome from the user’s perspective. What matters most is the quality and polish of the final result. That said, a from-scratch approach would be more beneficial in the context of eliminating legacy bugs.

Q: Can we have mockups for the Settings screen?
A: Feel free to implement this screen as you see fit. We consider this as a bonus task.

Q: Which link should we send in 'Profile Default 3.png'?
A: If the other party has incoming calls restricted, send them a link via 'Calls' → 'Create Call Link'.

Q: The icons provided earlier have a solid background.
A: We apologize for the inconvenience. We are attaching below the updated icons (https://t.me/contest/423).
