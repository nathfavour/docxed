# Animation & Motion System

## 1. Animation Levels

- **Off:** No animations, instant transitions (for accessibility/performance).
- **Minimal:** Only essential feedback (button presses, focus, etc.).
- **Moderate (Default):**  
  - Smooth transitions for theme/background changes.
  - Hover, tap, drag, and focus effects.
  - Animated stickers, emoji reactions, and message delivery.
  - Subtle background pattern movement (drift/parallax).
- **Maximal:**  
  - Enhanced micro-interactions (ripples, bounces, spring effects).
  - Animated chat bubbles, message send/receive, and group join/leave.
  - Full animated previews for stickers, backgrounds, and themes.

## 2. Theme Switching Animation

- **Circular Sweeping Wipe:**  
  - When switching themes, a circular wipe radiates from the user's pointer/tap, gradually revealing the new theme.
  - Optionally, a color sweep or glassy shimmer overlays the transition.
  - Animation duration and style are user-configurable.

## 3. Pattern & Sticker Animations

- Pattern backgrounds can animate (slow drift, color sweep, or parallax).
- Stickers and emoji can animate on send/receive, hover, or tap.
- All animations can be previewed in settings.

## 4. User Controls

- Animation level is user-selectable (off, minimal, moderate, maximal).
- All animation types can be enabled/disabled individually.
- Live preview for each animation type in settings.
- Future: users can create/upload their own animation packs.

## 5. Interaction Feedback

- All interactive elements respond visually to hover, focus, tap, drag, and drop.
- Transitions are smooth and consistent across the app.

## Summary

- Animations are modular, theme-aware, and fully user-controllable.
- All transitions and feedback are designed for delight and clarity, but never at the expense of usability or performance.
