# Frontend UI/UX System Overview

## 1. Theming & Styling System

- **Robust, Modular Theming:**  
  - All UI elements (colors, backgrounds, widget shapes, shadows, borders, radii, spacing, typography, etc.) are themeable.
  - Users can tweak any aspect of the UI via settings:  
    - Color palettes (primary, secondary, accent, background, surface, error, etc.)
    - Widget shapes (rounded, sharp, pill, custom SVG masks)
    - Shadows, reflections, glassmorphism, blur, and transparency
    - Font families, sizes, weights, and letter spacing
    - Animation levels and transitions
  - Themes are stored per-user and can be exported/imported.
  - Theme switching is instant, with animated transitions (see Animations).

- **Default Themes:**  
  - **Dark Mode:** Brick-wall/dirt-brown base, with medium contrast, warm highlights, and subtle glassmorphism.
  - **Light Mode:** Light brick-wall or light brown, soft shadows, and gentle reflections.
  - All themes use a motif/geometric pattern background (see below).

## 2. Motif/Patterned Backgrounds

- **Pattern Types:**  
  - Geometric shapes (lines, circles, triangles, polygons, etc.)
  - ASCII/Unicode emoji motifs (e.g., ☺, ★, ♫, etc.)
  - Doodle/illustrated seamless patterns
- **Implementation:**  
  - Patterns are generated in code (SVG, Canvas, or CSS), not images.
  - Patterns are colorless (outline only), adapting to theme (light/dark) for contrast.
  - Users can select from preset patterns or upload/generate custom ones.
  - Pattern scale, density, and opacity are adjustable.
  - Patterns can animate subtly (e.g., slow drift, parallax, or color sweep).

## 3. Database-Driven UI Features

- **User Profiles:**  
  - Avatar, display name, bio, status, credibility tier, and badges.
  - Username history and credibility score visualized (e.g., timeline, progress bar).
  - 2FA, verification, and recovery status indicators.

- **Chats & Messages:**  
  - Chat list with avatars, unread badges, last message preview, and pin/mute.
  - Chat window with message bubbles, reactions, reply threads, and system messages.
  - Message input with emoji/sticker picker, file upload, and E2E encryption status.
  - Group chat members, roles, and permissions UI.
  - Extension/bot messages with custom rendering.

- **Contacts & Devices:**  
  - Contact list with alias, status, and quick actions.
  - Device management: list, add, remove, and push notification status.

- **Settings:**  
  - Theme, background, and animation controls.
  - Profile, security, recovery, and extension settings.
  - Live preview for all customizations.

- **Extensions:**  
  - Bots, web3 wallets, integrations, each with their own UI modules.

## 4. Accessibility & Responsiveness

- Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high-contrast mode.
- Responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Touch, drag, swipe, and hover interactions.

## 5. Control & Flexibility

- Every visual and interactive aspect is user-tweakable.
- Presets for quick switching, but deep customization available.
- All changes previewable before saving.
- Future: users can create/share their own themes, patterns, and animation packs.
