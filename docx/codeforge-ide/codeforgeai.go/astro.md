We’re launching the first-ever Astrolescent MCP Hackathon, a 10-day online event designed to bring developers, prompt engineers, and AI tinkerers together to explore the Model Context Protocol and its real-time connection to DeFi.

Whether you’re building a chatbot, scripting an agent, or hacking together a price-checking tool, this is your chance to experiment, learn, and earn rewards — all while helping connect AI to live, decentralized data on Radix.

🧠 What is an MCP Server?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI agents (like ChatGPT, Claude, or custom tools) to access structured tools directly from a prompt. The Astrolescent MCP server exposes real-time data from the Radix DeFi ecosystem:

💸 Price: Live token prices in XRD and USD
🔁 Quote: Swap tokens across Radix DEXes
🌉 Bridge: Move assets between supported crypto chains
📈 APY: Real-time staking and liquidity yields
Think of it as a bridge between your LLM and on-chain data.

🎯 The Challenge
Build anything that uses the Astrolescent MCP server to make DeFi data usable inside an agent, app, or interface.

Ideas include:

LLM Trading Sidekick
Promptable GPT agent that acts like a DeFi assistant.
“What If I Staked…” Calculator
A calculator that answers: “If I stake 1,000 ASTRL today, what would I earn in 30 days?”
“Should I Stake or LP?” Helper
Prompt compares staking vs LP APY and gives basic advice.
Bonus: use MCPs from other projects like DefiPlaza or Aptos Earn
If your build connects AI to real DeFi data through MCP, it qualifies.
