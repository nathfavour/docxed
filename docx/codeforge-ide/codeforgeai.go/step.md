Step-by-Step Plan
Config Management

Ensure config is always loaded, saved, and validated.
Provide CLI commands to view and edit config.
Engine Initialization

Always load config fresh.
Instantiate models (general/code) based on config.
Provide methods for all core operations.
CLI Parsing

Use Cobra for hierarchical subcommands.
Each subcommand should call into the engine or integration modules.
Directory and File Utilities

Implement directory analysis, gitignore filtering, and file gathering.
Model Abstraction

GeneralModel and CodeModel should be pluggable (Ollama, OpenAI, Copilot, etc).
Allow dynamic selection based on config.
Core Operations

Implement: analyze, prompt, edit, suggestion, commit-message, explain, strip, etc.
Integrations

Each integration (web3, zerepy, solana, copilot, etc) is a separate module.
CLI subcommands should call into these modules.
Utilities

Pretty print, environment checks, etc.
Graceful Fallbacks

If an integration or dependency is missing, degrade gracefully.






















Implement directory analysis and file utilities.
Implement edit, suggestion, explain, and strip commands.
Flesh out integrations as independent modules.
Add graceful fallback for missing dependencies (e.g., check if gitmoji or tree is installed before using).
