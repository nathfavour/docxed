## Inspiration
We wanted to empower developers with real-time AI assistance and automation directly in their workflow.

## What it does
CodeForgeAI.go analyzes code, provides intelligent suggestions, integrates with external data, and automates common development tasks.

## How we built it
We used Go for performance, modularized the architecture, and integrated multiple AI and MCP services for extensibility.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating diverse AI models and ensuring smooth, fast user experience across different environments was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We achieved seamless AI integration, fast analysis, and a flexible system that adapts to various developer needs.

## What we learned
We learned how to optimize AI workflows in Go, design modular integrations, and prioritize developer experience.

## What's next for codeforge
We plan to add more integrations, improve collaboration features, and expand automation capabilities.
