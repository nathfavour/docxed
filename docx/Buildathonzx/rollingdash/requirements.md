🔌 DePIN x Mobility: Build a Smart Car Data Marketplace
• Global Track


At DeCharge, we’re on a mission to democratize energy and mobility infrastructure — and that begins with data. We're sponsoring a Breakout Hackathon bounty for builders who want to bring smart vehicle data to life and explore how it could power a decentralized marketplace.

We’re looking for scrappy builders and mobile devs ready to work with synthetic car data, prototype a marketplace app, and showcase what DePIN for smart mobility could look like. If you are hacking on this, we will help you out!

We’ve also partnered with Para to offer an additional $500 bounty for developers whose submissions use Para for wallets and authentication. Leverage Para’s mobile, web, and/or server SDKs to accelerate your build and boost your rewards!


🛠 Track Description & Inspiration
We believe the future of vehicle ownership is decentralised, data-rich, and user-owned. For this track, we're calling on hackers to:

Connect (or simulate) smart vehicles using synthetic OBD datasets

Visualize the kinds of data cars already generate

Let users choose what data they share on a peer-to-peer marketplace

Prototype token or incentive models that reward data contribution

You don’t need a Tesla — just grit, creativity, and a laptop.

Some ideas to get you rolling (remix or go wild):

Car-as-a-Node Explorer: Show users what their car is "emitting" in real time — speed, GPS, fuel, diagnostics — and simulate earnings for sharing it.

Mobility Data Marketplace: A clean mobile interface for users to list, share, or visualize data they’ve “collected” (even if it’s just synthetic).

Local Drive Simulator: Build a fake drive event or map replay where the app simulates data output, emissions, and rewards.

💰 Prizes
Total: $3,500 USDC

🏆 1st: $1500
🥈 2nd: $1000
🥉 3rd: $500

Best use of Para: $500

💡 What We’re Looking For
✅ Project devs that involve React Native or native mobile dev (Swift/Kotlin preferred)
✅ Uses synthetic OBD/car data to simulate real-world car data; we can help you with that on our community!
✅ Includes a short-form content piece (demo video, reel, or walkthrough)
✅ Bonus: You went the extra mile to ping a real smart car API (Smartcar, Tesla, any car APIs that you can dig into! Just reach out locally)
✅ Bonus: You tie in DePIN incentives or energy points system for data shared

✅ Bonus: You integrate Para’s mobile, web, and/or server SDKs to easily authenticate users, create non-custodial wallets, and/or post car data onchain

🧠 Who Should Apply
Indie hackers & data nerds

Mobile developers who can ship fast and clean

Builders excited about energy, mobility, and the DePIN movement

Anyone who wants to get their hands dirty with smart car data — synthetic or real


🚗 Kickstart Your Mobility Data Hack with These Resources 🛠️

Ready to build a DePIN-powered mobility data marketplace? We’ve got you covered. Use this starter pack to simulate smart car behavior, stream OBD data, and prototype your ideas — no real car required.

📦 Starter Kit Includes:
24-Hour Synthetic OBD Dataset (JSON) – Perfect for plugging into dashboards, analytics tools, or token models.

Matching CSV Version – Clean tabular format for mobile apps, charts, or marketplace listings.

Real-Time Data Simulator Script – Simulates live vehicle telemetry. Just run it with Python and start hacking!

🧠 What's in the data?
Speed, RPM, fuel level, engine temperature

GPS coordinates with minor variations

Diagnostic Trouble Codes (like P0420, P0171)

Timestamped minute-by-minute logs across 24 hours

✴️ What is Para?
The Para Modal is the easiest way to add authentication and non-custodial wallet creation to any web application. This approach allows your application to easily onboard users and perform onchain operations at the request of authenticated users.

Pregenerated wallets are a powerful feature that enable server-side wallet creation without requiring user authentication. This approach allows your application to perform autonomous onchain operations, making it ideal for agent-based systems, automated workflows, and backend services.

Para also offers comprehensive support for mobile and server development:

React Native SDK

Flutter SDK

Swift SDK

Server SDK

🌍 Who We Are
We’re DeCharge, building the world’s decentralised EV charging network. From India to the U.S., we’re helping people turn their parking lots and power plugs into profitable charging stations. But beyond just charging, we believe cars are becoming smart nodes in a massive data network — and this is your chance to build that future with us.

Ping us on Telegram & Para-slack and just start building!
