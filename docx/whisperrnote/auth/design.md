### Desktop

- **Sidebar (Left)**
  - Vertical navigation with icons and labels.
  - Prominent "New" action in the center.
  - Rounded corners and subtle shadow.
- **Main Area**
  - Top AppBar with app name and search bar.
  - Main content below AppBar, scrollable.
  - Uses padding and rounded corners for separation.

### Mobile

- **AppBar (Top)**
  - App name centered.
  - Search bar below title.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**
  - Horizontal navigation with icons and labels.
  - Prominent "New" action in the center.
  - Rounded corners and shadow.

## Shared UI Elements

  - Circular icon backgrounds with gradients.
  - "New" action is visually larger.
  - Labels below icons.
- **Search Bar**
  - Rounded, glassmorphic (blurred, semi-transparent) background.

## Visual Style

- **Color Palette**
  - Primary: Woody brown (`#8D6748`)
  - Secondary: Muted brick (`#BFAE99`)
  - Background: Soft beige (`#F5EFE6`)
  - White overlays for glassmorphism.
- **Typography**
  - Sans-serif, bold for titles.
  - Monospace for hashes.
- **Effects**
  - Glassmorphism: blur, semi-transparent backgrounds.
  - Shadows for depth.
  - Rounded corners throughout.

---

## Responsiveness

- Switches between sidebar (desktop) and bottom navigation (mobile) based on width.
- All elements use padding and adapt to screen size.

---

## Replication Guidelines

- Use a consistent color palette and rounded corners.
- Navigation should be visually distinct and accessible.
- Main actions ("New") should be prominent.
- Use glassmorphism for search bars and content cards.
- Ensure clear separation between navigation, search, and content.
- Maintain accessibility: contrast, touch targets, readable fonts.
