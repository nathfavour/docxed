## **The Challenge**

Build a Bankrbot extension using the [NEAR Shade Agents](http://near.ai/shade) stack, which enables:

- **Autonomy** – No ongoing user input needed
- **Non-custodial Control** – Users retain asset ownership
- **On-chain Verification** – Transparent and trustless
- **Multi-chain Execution** – Works across multiple chains

For example, a user posts a command on X and Bankrbot executes it; sending funds, calling a contract, or launching another action. You bring that capability to life.

***Note: You must use the [Shade Agents stack](http://near.ai/shade) (smart contracts, codehash validation, TEE worker agent design) to be eligible.***







## **Requirements**

**To qualify for a prize, your submission must meet the following criteria**:

- Users can interact with your agent entirely from X
- If your agent requires a token transfer, users can transfer from Bankr directly on X
- Your agent is running within a TEE and has a corresponding smart contract (the shade agent stack)
- All transactions from your agent are signed using chain signatures (the shade agent stack)
- Be **open source** with a valid license and public repo
- Include original, non-malicious, and properly attributed code
